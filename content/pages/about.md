Title: About

Iâ€™m a Seattle-based data scientist and developer.

Over the past year, I taught Physics at Shoreline Community College.

Before that, I was a graduate student at the University of California Riverside working on astrophysics research, statistically analyzing images from Hubble Ultra Deep Field.
